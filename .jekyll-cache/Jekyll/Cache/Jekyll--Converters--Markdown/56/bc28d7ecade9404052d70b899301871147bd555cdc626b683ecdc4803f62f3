<p>A fun side project I made as a tool to help our design team examine what their type will look like on a live page. Implements Huluâ€™s variable typeface and built in a jekyll enviroment. Much thanks to <a href="https://www.xk9.com">XK9</a> and <a href="https://commercialtype.com/about">Commercial Type</a> for working together to build the variable type. Click <a href="https://mochimilk.github.io/Graphik-Variable/">here</a> or the link in the prelude to try it out yourself!</p>
