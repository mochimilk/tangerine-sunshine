<p>Huluâ€™s web design system takes its root from what weâ€™ve all come to know and love in the Hulu app. Weâ€™ve worked hard on building a complementary web-focused design system that lives harmoiously with the product teamâ€™s existing groundwork. These components are used across the board in Huluâ€™s campaign sites, ad managers, as well as microsites.</p>

<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3>

<p>We were tasked with solidifying existing product colors into web. Our goal was to create a set of colors that would complement the existing color palette, while also adding new visual interest and flexibility to our designs.
<br /><br />
To begin the process, we conducted a thorough analysis of our existing color system, taking into account the overall visual aesthetic and the specific use cases of each color.
<br /><br />
Once we were satisfied with our color palette, we updated our figma to be globally available to our team, along with proper documentation.
<br /><br />
Overall, the process of introducing new colors to our design system was a collaborative effort that required extensive research, experimentation, and testing. The end result was a set of new colors that added new visual interest and flexibility to our designs, while maintaining the overall cohesiveness of our existing system.</p>
