I"<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of this project was to design and develop a website for Winter Triton Fest 2020. Winter Triton Fest is an annual late night, weekend event series held at the beginning of winter quarters at UC San Diego. They host a number of events, including talks from Josh Peck, Stephanie Soo, Anne Phung, and more.</p>

<h2 id="role">Role</h2>

<p>I wore many hats in this project as a lot of the staff was out for winter break üò≠. However, it challenged me to build a project independently. For this project, I took the role in <strong>UX/UI, frontend, and branding</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>

<p>When first thinking of building the site, I took into consideration what students would use the site for. Looking at prior Triton Fest sites, I saw that it consisted of a list of events, each linking to a corresponding facebook event page. Though the site was functional, it wasn‚Äôt so much practical as it took the viewer out of the site and into Facebook.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a site that would allow students to explore and share all the events offered at Triton Fest without having to leave the site itself. To do this, I kept three things in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an experience that makes it easy for students to delve into all the events.</li>
  <li>Make ‚Äúlocation‚Äù and ‚Äúdate‚Äù easily ‚Äúscreen-shotable‚Äù so that students can share.</li>
  <li>Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it regardless of where they are viewing it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>For this project, I was inspired by similar sites that focused on marketing their individual events. My mood boards stretched from festival websites to facebook and yelp event listings.</p>

<p>I wanted to make the entirety of the Triton Fest website as informationally minimalistic as possible ‚Äî just like the cards I used for my mood board ‚Äî displaying only event, time, date, and location. In doing so would make the site a brief, yet informative and enjoyable experience.</p>

<h2 id="branding">Branding</h2>

<p>For the branding, I settled on using bold colors that would be easily recognized across all mediums (web, posters, social media). This particular color palette was chosen to convey a ‚Äúwinter‚Äù vibe. The main font used for the project was <strong>AO Mono</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="final-product">Final Product</h2>

<p>The finalized website took a couple days of work (including branding), moving from brainstorming through process development quickly. The result was a site that checked all my initial proposals. Each event page was simple and informative, and scrolled down to a list of the other events so that the user would be able to keep exploring within the ecosystem of the website. It was also built to be responsive, enabling users to view it anywhere. As a bonus ‚Äî being both the brand designer as well as the developer ‚Äî I was able to create a site that corresponded with print assets</p>
