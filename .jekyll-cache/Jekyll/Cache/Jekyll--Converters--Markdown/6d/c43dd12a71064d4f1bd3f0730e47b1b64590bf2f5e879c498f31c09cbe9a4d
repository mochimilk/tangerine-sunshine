<h2 id="building-brutal-to-spotlight-content">Building brutal to spotlight content</h2>

<p>The objective of this project was to create a website for Other People Literary Magazine. I also had the task of leading a team of designers and developers to build it. In having a team of students that would eventually graduate and go off start adulting, we needed to be mindful of making a site that could easily be passed onto others.</p>

<h2 id="role">Role</h2>

<p>The team consisted of the other creative co-director and a product designer.  I was responsible for overseeing and developing the <strong>UX/UI design</strong>, <strong>frontend development</strong>, as well as designing the overall <strong>brand/identity</strong> of Other People. The team worked in conjunction during our ideation.</p>

<h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>

<p>When first brainstorming this project, we wanted to <strong>create an experience focused on readership/viewership</strong>. We also wanted to <strong>create a modular design system</strong>; In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. The third objective was to <strong>create a site on a content management system</strong> so that the editorial team can easily update the front matter.</p>

<p>And, of course, it had to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>Our proposal was to, first, create a <strong>minimalist/brutalist design</strong> for the site that would place focus on the contributions (literature and art). It allowed for minimal distractions and prioritized the readership/viewership.</p>

<p>Our second proposal was to use a coding language that could not only be modular, but easily learned/recognized. For this, we decided to use a <strong>Jekyll/Sass</strong> combo.</p>

<p>Our third proposal was to use a headless content management system, so that — in the case of a system falling off trend — the designers could easily chop the head off and replace it. For this, we decided to use <strong>Forestry.io</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a minimalist/brutalist design for max readability.</li>
  <li>Make an easy/modular coding design system</li>
  <li>Use a headless CMS</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>One of the things that drew us into creating a brutalist design for Other People was the capacity to make an easy design system. Further, having these modules/components enabled the designers and developers to work more closely together as it acted like a sort of buffer between the two. We utilized Figma to translate design into development.</p>

<p>Another thing that drew us to a brutalist design was that stray away from a corporate look to a more liberal and human design.</p>

<p>We also used Jekyll to build modules through “includes”, making each component of the site easily modifiable/replaceable. This also made the index.html page simple to explore.</p>
