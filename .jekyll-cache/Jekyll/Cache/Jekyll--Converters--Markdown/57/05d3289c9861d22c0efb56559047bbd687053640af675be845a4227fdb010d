I"H<!-- I hate writing these things. It's like writing an autobiography of my professional life and saying "look at all the awesome things I've done!!!" when, as a designer, all I do is look at my own work critically. I even go to *other* designers on a daily basis to look for all the not-so-awesome stuff in my work after having worked it for so long myself that "good design" and "suck" has morphed into a blob of blue-light emitting uncertainty. Regardless, I've been given the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects, so I'm eternally grateful for that.

<p>I am a visual designer, currently living in La Jolla, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and developing during my two years as a literature &amp; writing major at UC San Diego. My first design job was here, as a student designer at <a href="https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu" title="AS Graphic Studio">Associated Students Graphic Studio</a>, where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of <a href="otherpeoplesd.com" title="Other People">Other People</a>, a student-run literary magazine on campus.</p>

<p>I am currently a Visual Designer at <a href="Kiva.org" title="Kiva.org">Kiva</a>, working with a team of amazing designers to help build a product that creates financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover. üê∂üçµ</p>
