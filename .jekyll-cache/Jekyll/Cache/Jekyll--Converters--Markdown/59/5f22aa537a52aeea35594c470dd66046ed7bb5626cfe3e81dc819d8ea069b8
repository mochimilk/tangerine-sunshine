I"¬<p>I hate writing these things. Itâ€™s like writing an autobiography of my professional life and saying â€œlook at all the cool things Iâ€™ve done!!!â€ when â€” as a designer â€” all I do is look at my own work critically. Or maybe Iâ€™m just a pessimist. Either way, this very pessimism is what got me to where I am today, and I am eternally grateful.</p>

<p>I am a visual designer, currently living in La Jolla, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and developing during my two years as a literature &amp; writing major at UC San Diego (I know, writing. Wild). My first job was here, as a student designer at <a href="https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu" title="AS Graphic Studio">Associated Students Graphic Studio</a>, where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of <a href="otherpeoplesd.com" title="Other People">Other People</a>, a student-run literary magazine on campus.</p>

<p>I am currently a Visual Designer at <a href="Kiva.org" title="Kiva.org">Kiva</a>, working with a team of amazing designers to help create a product that gives the underserved population a chance to grow as individuals,  as businesses, and as communities.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover. ğŸ¶ğŸµ</p>
