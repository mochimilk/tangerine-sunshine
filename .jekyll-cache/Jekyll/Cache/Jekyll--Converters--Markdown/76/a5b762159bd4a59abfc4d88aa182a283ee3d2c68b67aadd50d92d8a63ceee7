<h3 id="role">Role</h3>

<p>My role here was as a solo designer, buidling the experience from the ground up. I worked with my design manager and the dev team to assist on user testing and development.</p>

<p>One of the stakeholder asks was to showcase our breadth of content at Hulu to show potential advertisers what shows their ad will be shown on.</p>

<h2 id="here-you-can-see-the-implementation-of-a-show-tile-carousel-that-both-auto-scrolls-and-can-be-manually-scrolled-by-the-user">Here, you can see the implementation of a show tile carousel that both auto scrolls and can be manually scrolled by the user.</h2>

<p>I designed this masthead corresponding with Huluâ€™s brand values - bold, clean, fun - while also maintaining high functional value.</p>

<p>It was also inspired by Trevor Paglenâ€™s <em>Site Unseen</em> installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD). What I found intriguing of his piece was the binary between the things visible in the tanglible world opposed to artificial intellgence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>â€œPaglenâ€™s photographs show something we are not meant to see, whose concealment he regards as symptomatic of the historical moment we inhabit. His objects act in opposition to what his images have exposed, imagining another and potentially different world.</em></p>

  <p><em>â€” MCASD</em></p>

<p>Using Paglenâ€™s work as an influence, I decided on creating a binary between the La Jolla obsucra and a digital obscura. I added components of camera viewfinders, auto/manual focus, and blurring to portray this; The space between the two is where I implemented the glitches, stretching photos and pixel sorting (implemented through processing.js).</p>

<p>Sun God Festivalâ€™s website was inspired much in the same way as the art direction. Interactive elements were designed and deployed throughout the page to correspond with the overall aesthetic. With the help of Emily as the developer, we were able to create a unique digital experience for the festival page. This project was built on Jekyll and SASS.</p>
