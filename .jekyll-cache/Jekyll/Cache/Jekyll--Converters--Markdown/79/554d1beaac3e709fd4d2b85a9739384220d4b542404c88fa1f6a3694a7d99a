I"Ó<p>I hate writing these things. Itâ€™s like writing an autobiography of my professional life and saying â€œlook at all the awesome things Iâ€™ve done!!!â€ when, as a designer, all I <em>do</em> is look at my own work critically. I even go to other designers on a daily basis to look for all the not-so-awesome stuff in my work after having worked it for so long myself that â€œgood designâ€ and â€œsuckâ€ has morphed into a blob of blue-light emitting uncertainty. Regardless, Iâ€™ve been given the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects, so Iâ€™m eternally grateful for that.</p>

<p>I am a visual designer, currently living in La Jolla, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and developing during my two years as a literature &amp; writing major at UC San Diego (I know, writing. Wild). My first job â€” apart from the restaurant jobs I had in highschool â€” was here, as a student designer at <a href="https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu" title="AS Graphic Studio">Associated Students Graphic Studio</a>, where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of <a href="otherpeoplesd.com" title="Other People">Other People</a>, a student-run literary magazine on campus.</p>

<p>I am currently a Visual Designer at <a href="Kiva.org" title="Kiva.org">Kiva</a>, working with a team of amazing designers to help create a product that gives the underserved population a chance to grow as individuals,  as businesses, and as communities.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover. ğŸ¶ğŸµ</p>
