<p>I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and dev during my two years as a literature &amp; writing major at UC San Diego. My first design job was as a student designer at <a href="https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu" title="AS Graphic Studio">Associated Students Graphic Studio</a>, where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of <a href="otherpeoplesd.com" title="Other People">Other People</a>, a student-run literary magazine on campus.</p>

<p>From 2020-2022, I was a Visual Designer at <a href="Kiva.org" title="Kiva.org">Kiva</a>, working with a team of amazing designers to help build a product that creates financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.</p>

<p>I am currently a Visual Designer at <a href="hulu.com" title="Hulu">Hulu</a>.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover.</p>
