<h3 id="role">Role</h3>

<p>My role here was as a solo designer, buidling the experience from the ground up. I worked with my design manager and the dev team to assist on user testing and development.</p>

<p>One of the stakeholder asks was to showcase our breadth of content at Hulu to show potential advertisers what shows their ad will be shown on.</p>

<h2 id="here-you-can-see-the-implementation-of-a-show-tile-carousel-that-both-auto-scrolls-and-can-be-manually-scrolled-by-the-user">Here, you can see the implementation of a show tile carousel that both auto scrolls and can be manually scrolled by the user.</h2>

<p>I designed this masthead corresponding with Hulu’s brand values - bold, clean, fun - while also maintaining high functional value.</p>

<p>It was also inspired by Trevor Paglen’s <em>Site Unseen</em> installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD). What I found intriguing of his piece was the binary between the things visible in the tanglible world opposed to artificial intellgence.</p>
