Given both the brutalist nature of the schoolâ€™s architecture along with the high functionality of the art form itself, our team wanted to design a site that could live cohesively within those two spheres.</h2>

<p>My role was here was to design/develop the frontend site, create a global search function, as well as implement a CMS that others on my team could easily manage.</p>

<p>One of the things that drew us into creating a brutalist design for Other People was that it allowed for minimal distractions and prioritized the readership/viewership of student work. It also made the process of building a modular design system much easuer. Having these modules/components enabled the designers and developers to build more quickly while maintaining the brand identity.</p>
