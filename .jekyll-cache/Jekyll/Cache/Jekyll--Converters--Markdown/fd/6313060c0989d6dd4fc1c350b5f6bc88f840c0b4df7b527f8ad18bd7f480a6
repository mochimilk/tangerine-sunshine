<p>Huluâ€™s web design system takes its root from what weâ€™ve all come to know and love in the Hulu app. Weâ€™ve worked hard on building a complementary web-focused design system that lives harmoiously with the product teamâ€™s existing groundwork. These components are used across the board in Huluâ€™s campaign sites, ad managers, as well as microsites.</p>
