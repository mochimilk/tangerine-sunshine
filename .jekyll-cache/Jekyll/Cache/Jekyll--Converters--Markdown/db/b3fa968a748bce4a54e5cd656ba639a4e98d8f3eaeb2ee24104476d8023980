<h3 id="role">Role</h3>

<p>My role in Refuge Studio was to bring together a team of 3D designers, artists, and developers in creating a strong team with the ability</p>

And for this, I decided to design a community experience for the users. By selecting one of the categories from the dropdown menu would open a space for that particular category (all categories if ‚Äúall‚Äù is selected). This compartmentalization of categories was inspired by subreddits in Reddit. I hoped to build a similar product where community engagement is principle in the design.</h2>

<p>I was also able to make a ‚Äúcreate post‚Äù module using a single-page overlay. To do this, I researched the ease and convenience of posting in other popular sites like facebook, twitter, and reddit. However, with all the information needed to create a Craigslist posting (particularly to allow posts from users without accounts), the module had to be larger to fit more fields. To do this, I created a postcard-esque design, keeping metadata fields at the left and making a body field at the right. I also minimized any non-essentials into an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù menu (i.e for phone numbers and addresses).</p>

<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>

<p>I decided to go with a sans-serif typeface for the branding in order to keep the aesthetic of the website as unobtrusive as possible (especially with the amount of text that is displayed on the screen at any given time).</p>

<p>For the color palette, I wanted to convey change from the past Craigslist into a newer and refreshed brand. To do this, I opted for a color gradient, flowing from its classic purple to a lighter blue.</p>
