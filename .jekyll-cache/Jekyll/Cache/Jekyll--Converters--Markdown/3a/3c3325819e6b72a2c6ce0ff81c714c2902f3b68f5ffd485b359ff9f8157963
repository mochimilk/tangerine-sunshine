<p>All good things come from waste.</p>

<p>I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. My first design job was as a student designer at <a href="https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu" title="AS Graphic Studio">Associated Students Graphic Studio</a>, where I had the opportunity to lead in design for Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. That position then led to my creative co-director position at <a href="https://otherpeoplesd.com" title="Other People">Other People</a>, a student-run literary magazine on campus.</p>

<p>From 2020-2022, I designed for <a href="Kiva.org" title="https://kiva.org">Kiva</a>, working to help build a product that enables financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.</p>

<p>I am currently at <a href="https://hulu.com" title="Hulu">Hulu</a>, pushing for a bold, clean, fun aesthetic across brand and product.</p>

<p>In my free time I like writing, coding, playing games, and listening to music.</p>
