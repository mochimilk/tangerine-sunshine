## Objective

The objective of this project was to design and develop a website for Winter Triton Fest 2020. Winter Triton Fest is an annual late night, weekend event series held at the beginning of winter quarters at UC San Diego. They host a number of events, including talks from Josh Peck, Stephanie Soo, Anne Phung, and more.

## Role

I wore many hats in this project as a lot of the staff was out for winter break 😭. However, it challenged me to build a project independently. For this project, I built the **UX/UI, the brand design, and social media assets**.

## Brainstorming

When first thinking of building the site, I took into consideration what students would use the site for. Looking at prior Triton Fest sites, I saw that it consisted of a list of events, each linking to a corresponding facebook event page. Though the site was functional, it wasn't so much practical as it took the viewer out of the site and into Facebook.

## Proposal

I wanted to create a site that would allow students to explore and share all the events offered at Triton Fest without having to leave the site itself. To do this, I kept three things in mind:

* Create an experience that makes it easy for students to delve into all the events.
* Make "location" and "date" easily "screen-shotable" so that students can share.
* Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it regardless of how they are viewing it.

## Process

### Research

For this project, I was inspired by similar sites that focused on marketing their individual events. My mood boards stretched from festival websites to facebook and yelp event listings.![](/uploads/Screen Shot 2020-05-08 at 11.30.03 PM.png)_Event component mood boards_

### Personas

I drew up three personas to help with my user experience flow: the library sulker, the commuter, and the enthused.
