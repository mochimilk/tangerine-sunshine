## Product Harmony

Hulu's web design system takes its root from what we've all come to know and love in the Hulu app. We've worked hard on building a complementary web-focused design system that lives harmoiously with the product team's existing groundwork. These components are used across the board in Hulu's campaign sites, ad managers, as well as microsites.
