### she/her

## I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. I started as a student designer at UC San Diego as both a graphic designer for [Associated Students Graphic Studio](https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu "AS Graphic Studio") and as a creative co-director for [Other People](https://otherpeoplesd.com "Other People"), a student-run literary magazine.

## From 2020-2022, I designed for [Kiva](Kiva.org "https://kiva.org"), working to help build a product that enables financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.

## More recently, I worked in-house for [Hulu](https://hulu.com "Hulu"), pushing for a bold, clean, fun aesthetic across brand, web and product.

## In my free time I like writing, coding, playing games, and listening to music.
