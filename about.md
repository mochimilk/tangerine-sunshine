<!-- I hate writing these things. It's like writing an autobiography of my professional life and saying "look at all the awesome things I've done!!!" when, as a designer, all I do is look at my own work critically. I even go to _other_ designers on a daily basis to look for all the not-so-awesome stuff in my work after having worked it for so long myself that "good design" and "suck" has morphed into a blob of blue-light emitting uncertainty. Regardless, I've been given the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects, so I'm eternally grateful for that. --> 

I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and dev during my two years as a literature & writing major at UC San Diego. My first design job was as a student designer at [Associated Students Graphic Studio](https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu "AS Graphic Studio"), where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of [Other People](otherpeoplesd.com "Other People"), a student-run literary magazine on campus.

I am currently a Visual Designer at [Kiva](Kiva.org "Kiva.org"), working with a team of amazing designers to help build a product that creates financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.

In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover. üê∂üçµ
