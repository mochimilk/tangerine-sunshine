### she/her

## I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. I started as a student designer at UC San Diego as both a graphic designer for <i>Associated Students Graphic Studio</i> and as a creative co-director for <i>Other People</i>, a student-run literary magazine.

## From 2020-2022, I designed for <i>Kiva</i>, working to help build a product that enables financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.

## More recently, I worked in-house for <i>Hulu</i>, pushing for a bold, clean, fun aesthetic across brand, web and product.

## In my free time I like writing, coding, playing games, and listening to music.
