### (she/her)

## I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. My first design job was as a student designer at [Associated Students Graphic Studio](https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu "AS Graphic Studio"), where I had the opportunity to lead in design for Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. That position then led to my creative co-director position at [Other People](https://otherpeoplesd.com "Other People"), a student-run literary magazine on campus.

## From 2020-2022, I designed for [Kiva](Kiva.org "https://kiva.org"), working to help build a product that enables financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.

## I am currently at [Hulu](https://hulu.com "Hulu"), pushing for a bold, clean, fun aesthetic across brand and product.

## In my free time I like writing, coding, playing games, and listening to music.
