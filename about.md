### (she/her)

I am a visual designer, currently based in Los Angeles, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I found an affinity for product design and dev during my two years as a literature & writing major at UC San Diego. My first design job was as a student designer at [Associated Students Graphic Studio](https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu "AS Graphic Studio"), where I had the opportunity to design for events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of [Other People](https://otherpeoplesd.com "Other People"), a student-run literary magazine on campus.

From 2020-2022, I was a Visual Designer at [Kiva](Kiva.org "https://kiva.org"), working with a team of amazing designers to help build a product that creates financial inclusion for the underserved community, giving them equal opportunity to grow professionally, individually, and communally.

I am currently a Visual Designer at [Hulu](https://hulu.com "Hulu").

In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover.
